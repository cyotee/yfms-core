CONTRACTS ARE NOT FINALIZED - STILL IN PROGRESS

## <b>Synopsis</b>

Vault Contracts for the stable coins are currently being stored in a private directory, they will be available when vaults launch.<br>
On the 23rd the YFMSVault will launch and staking will officially be available.<br>
This means that 100% of the vault rewards are going towards the YFMS vault.<br>
Meaning on the first day all 82 tokens will be distributed to wallets in this vault.<br>
The 50% buy-back burn mechanism will become live after stable coin vaults launch (roughly 2 weeks from the 23rd).<br>
A YFMS-UNI LP pool will become available roughly 1 week after the 23rd, launching before stable coin vaults.<br>
To ensure code safety and integrity, the contracts for the stable coin vaults and YFMS-UNI pool will be audited by multiple parties.<br>
